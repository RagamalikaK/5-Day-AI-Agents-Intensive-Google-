The Problem
Without tools, the agent's knowledge is frozen in time — it can't access today's news or your company's inventory. It has no connection to the outside world, so the agent can't take actions for you.

The Solution: Tools are what transform your isolated LLM into a capable agent that can actually help you get things done.

In this notebook, you'll:
✅ Turn your Python functions into Agent tools
✅ Build an Agent and use it as a tool in another agent
✅ Build your first multi-tool agent
✅ Explore the different tool types in ADK
